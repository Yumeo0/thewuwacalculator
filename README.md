# The Wuwa Calculator

Fan made tools for planning, simulating, and optimizing builds in *Wuthering Waves*.

This repository contains the production app. Its navigation is `Home > Read / Simulation`. Simulation includes Modulation, Rotation, Showcase, Optimizer, and Suggestions. Read includes guides, reference docs, the changelog, and information pages. The repository also contains runtime data and the Cloudflare Worker used for deployment.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Node `24.x`

Install and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
npm run dev:cloudflare
npm run deploy:cloudflare
```

## Environment

Local Google Drive sync and OAuth flows expect:

```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5174
```

Browser side configuration uses `VITE_*` values. Server side OAuth exchange and refresh use the non `VITE_*` variables.

## Repo Map

- `src/app`
  App bootstrap, providers, and router wiring.
- `src/data`
  Checked in content plus game data bootstrap and catalog loaders.
- `src/domain`
  Durable entities, game-data contracts, pure value types, and domain services.
- `src/engine`
  Formulas, effects, simulation, suggestions, parser logic, and optimizer execution.
- `src/infra`
  Browser-platform storage, Google Drive sync, OAuth and share server handlers, cookies, and analytics.
- `src/modules/home`
  The Home page.
- `src/modules/read`
  Docs, guides, changelog, and information pages.
- `src/modules/simulation`
  Modulation, Rotation, Showcase, Optimizer, Suggestions, and their shared workspace features.
- `src/modules/calibration` and `src/modules/system`
  Appearance, app preferences, data management, and system fallback pages.
- `src/shared`
  Shared UI primitives, shell components, and low level helpers.
- `public/data`
  Checked-in, mode-scoped runtime JSON used by core startup and lazy Simulation data loading.
- `scripts`
  Git-ignored local maintenance workflows for runtime data and assets. Their commands require the author's private working-copy scripts.
- `docs`
  Documentation for maintainers.

## Deployment

The app deploys as a Cloudflare Worker with static assets from `dist`. The Worker handles Google OAuth exchange and refresh endpoints plus share creation and retrieval under `/api/shares`; production shares use the `SHARES` KV binding.

Basic deploy flow:

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
npm run deploy:cloudflare
```

The public Google client ID and redirect URI are configured as Worker variables. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` must remain a secret, and the production `SHARES` KV namespace must be bound before share links can work.

Deployment configuration is in [wrangler.jsonc](./wrangler.jsonc). Cross origin isolation headers are defined in [public/_headers](./public/_headers).
