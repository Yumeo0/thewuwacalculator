# Lifecycle owners

Classes in this app own resources whose lifetime crosses calls. Game data records, persisted scenarios, rotation program nodes, and formula inputs remain plain data so they can be serialized, cloned, compared, and sent to workers.

| Owner | Responsibility | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WorkerChannel` | Request IDs, pending replies, progress, errors, and idle teardown | One feature client |
| `EvaluationClient` | Worker transport, in-flight work, bounded report caches, and active cancellation | Evaluation module |
| `SuggestionsClient`, `RandomEchoClient`, `DataImportClient` | Feature-specific worker messages and results | Their feature modules |
| `OptimizerRunController` | Lazy pool loading and invalidating a run cancelled during import | Optimizer client module |
| `OptimizerWorkerPool` | Task workers, ordered queue, active run generation, and theory producers | Optimizer worker module |
| `OptimizerCompileSession` | Store run token and compile worker requests | Application store module |
| `GameDataSession` | Bootstrap, HMR-backed registry state, scoped kit loading, leases, and delayed release/trim | Game data module; backing registry state survives HMR as plain data |
| `ScenarioRecordRepository` | Scenario record reads, validated writes, identity reuse, and delayed cleanup | Persistence module |
| `PersistenceCoordinator` | Dirty domain notifications and flush queue | Persistence module |
| `GpuResourceSession` | One initialized payload's buffers and explicit disposal | Each target or rotation GPU runner |
| `HistoryCompactor` | Bounded history compression queue and one active worker | Application history module |
| `RotationEditorRetentionController` | Mounted editor leases and delayed heavy trace release | Rotation editor module |

Each module keeps its existing exported functions as facades. Callers do not hold class instances, and worker request formats and local storage keys do not change. Pure domain calculations stay as functions; introducing a class there would add identity and lifecycle where the calculation has neither.
